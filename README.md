# Learning Python

Welcome to my Python learning journey. This repository documents my progress and practice as I build foundational and advanced Python skills, especially for data science and analytics.

## 📘 Current Notebook

### [`Python For Data Science 2.ipynb`](./Python%20For%20Data%20Science%202.ipynb)

This notebook includes hands-on Python exercises focused on data science fundamentals. Topics covered may include:

- Python basics: variables, loops, functions
- Data types and structures
- Working with libraries like NumPy, Matplotlib and pandas
- Data manipulation and visualization
- Real-world datasets and practical applications

> 📅 I’m committing regularly to track my growth and stay consistent.



## 🚀 Goals

- Practice Python daily and commit to GitHub regularly 🟩
- Master core programming concepts and tools
- Build confidence in data analysis and visualization
- Prepare for real-world data science applications


## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, NumPy, matplotlib (and other common data science libraries)
- Git & GitHub
